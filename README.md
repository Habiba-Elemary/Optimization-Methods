# Optimization-Methods
This project is a part of my Operation Research Course where the objective was to implement the simplex, big m, graphical and two phase methods from scratch using python.
Overview
This project is a comprehensive implementation of various optimization algorithms used in Operation Research. The algorithms implemented include the Simplex Method, Graphical Method, Big M Method, and Two-Phase Method. All methods were implemented entirely from scratch without the use of any external libraries. The goal of this project is to provide a clear understanding of how these algorithms work and to demonstrate their application in solving linear programming problems.

Algorithms Implemented

1. Simplex Method:
A popular algorithm for solving linear programming problems.
Handles both maximization and minimization problems.
Implements the standard simplex algorithm with tableau operations.

2. Graphical Method:
A visual approach to solving linear programming problems with two decision variables.
Plots the feasible region and identifies the optimal solution graphically.

3. Big M Method:
A technique used to handle constraints with artificial variables.
Converts problems with "greater-than-or-equal-to" constraints into standard form.

4. Two-Phase Method:
An alternative to the Big M method for handling artificial variables.
Solves linear programming problems in two phases: feasibility and optimization.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
matplotlib (only for the Graphical Method)

Key Features
No External Libraries: All algorithms are implemented from scratch.
Modular Code: Each method is implemented in a separate module for clarity and reusability.
Test Cases: Includes test cases for each method to ensure correctness.
Graphical Visualization: The Graphical Method includes plotting capabilities for better understanding.
